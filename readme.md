- background tracking(migrate event on app.xaml.cs dont forget to unhook the event) - done
- database saving -- remove usage model, fix app tracking services - done (net tested)

- testing 

- show database in database(done)

- showing of time broke

- next is graph (missing now is just the weekly data)

- next is stopping/blocking apps

- folder fixing, actually its good enough since its smol

bug:
